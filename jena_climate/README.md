## How to build the project

### Generate the model
1. To generate and train the model you should use the Examen_R3 notebook.
2.  The only parameters you just need to are in the second cell of the notebook. The `project_path` and the third line where is changing of directory. You will replace them and you will put the path of the directory where is located your notebook. 
3. That's it, now just run all the cells of code

The notebook will create two folders, `in` and `out`, inside the out folder you will find the best model that was trained.
